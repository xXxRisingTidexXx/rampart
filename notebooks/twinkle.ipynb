    "Twinkle is a flat ranking model based on the learning to rank (LTR) technique. [Lambdarank](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/02/MSR-TR-2010-82.pdf) is used as the main logical engine. The final ranker is supposed to relevantly order housing publications to a final Telegram user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I/O\n",
    "All datasets lie in `../scientific/binaries` . Final model must be stored into `../scientific/models/twinkle.latest.txt` .\n",

    "## Metadata\n",
    "Dataset files have self-explained names:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<tag>.<group>.bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "70e36b1e47754064ad14b57a5c79d5bc.validation.bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "Placeholders in angle brackets:\n",
    "- `tag` , UUID4 generated hash.\n",
    "- `group` , dataset's destination - one of `training` or `validation` .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",

    "- `total_floor` - house's floor count.\n",
    "- `desired_floor` - target flat's floor.\n",
    "- `housing` - either a newbuild or a used apartments.\n",
