    "Twinkle is a flat ranking model based on the learning to rank (LTR) technique. [Lambdarank](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/02/MSR-TR-2010-82.pdf) is used as the main logical engine. The final ranker is supposed to relevantly order housing publications to a final Telegram user. Real-time ranking power can be checked via a local dev service **browsing** .\n",

    "## I/O\n",
    "Required data consists of two parts:\n",
    "- Training tabular data lies in `../data/twinkle/training.csv` ;\n",
    "- Testing (validation) tabular data lies in `../data/twinkle/testing.csv` .\n",
    "\n",
    "Output model must be stored into `../models/twinkle.txt` .\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "- `actual_price` - true flat's price (in USD);\n",
    "- `utmost_price` - query's price limit (in USD), search results shouldn't exceed much this shape;\n",
    "- `total_area` - overall apartment's area (in square meters);\n",
    "- `living_area` - flat's living room area (in square meters);\n",
    "- `kitchen_area` - flat's kitchen area (in square meters);\n",
    "- `actual_room_number` - true flat's living room amount;\n",
    "- `desired_room_number` - target room count;\n",
    "- `actual_floor` - apartment's floor (the ground floor is the floor #1);\n",
    "- `total_floor` - house's floor count;\n",
    "- `desired_floor` - target flat's floor;\n",
    "- `housing` - either a newbuild or a used apartments;\n",
    "- `ssf` - Subway Station Factor, the score indicating about subway stations nearby;\n",
    "- `izf` - Industrial Zone Factor, the score indicating about factories & plants nearby;\n",
    "- `gzf` - Green Zone Factor, the score indicating about parks nearby;\n",
    "- `relevance` - sample's search quality (just for training);\n",
    "- `query` - sample's group ID (just for training).\n",
