    "Auge is an image classification model. Its main target's to recognize common photos to determine a few flat publication's features. Each image belongs to a specific realty, having a bunch of photo & panorama recognized **twinkle** can better predict apartments' order.\n",

    "## I/O\n",
    "Required data consists of two parts + remote image CDN:\n",
    "- Training references lie in `../data/auge/training.csv` ;\n",
    "- Testing links lie in `../data/auge/testing.csv` .\n",

    "Currently the DB containes images of two types: simple photos & wide (360 deg) panoramas. Until a stable classification model panoramas should be omitted. Final classifier must be stored into `../models/auge.pth` .\n",

    "- `luxury` is a flat with rich furniture, huge rooms, chandeliers, fireplaces, etc.\n",
    "![Luxury 1](../images/luxury1.webp)\n",
    "![Luxury 2](../images/luxury2.webp)\n",
    "![Luxury 3](../images/luxury3.webp)\n",
    "- `comfort` is the most suitable for an ordinary citizen apartments. Clean, neat, sometimes minimalistic, average area, qualitive furniture, etc.\n",
    "![Comfort 1](../images/comfort1.webp)\n",
    "![Comfort 2](../images/comfort2.webp)\n",
    "![Comfort 3](../images/comfort3.webp)\n",
    "- `construction` is a flat without a finished design. No doors, floor, supplies, wallpapers, ceiling, furniture, etc. Typically, new buildings contain these apartments.\n",
    "![Construction 1](../images/construction1.webp)\n",
    "![Construction 2](../images/construction2.webp)\n",
    "![Construction 3](../images/construction3.webp)\n",
    "- `junk` is an old flat image. Probably, the whole apartments should belong to a dormitory, Khrushchevka or gostinka.\n",

    "![Junk 2](../images/junk2.webp)\n",

    "![Obsolete 2](../images/obsolete2.webp)\n",
    "![Obsolete 3](../images/obsolete3.webp)\n",
    "- `outline` is not a flat itself, it's just a drawing. Quite unpredictable label, but often these photos are attached to flats in new houses.\n",

    "![Outline 2](../images/outline2.webp)\n",
    "![Outline 3](../images/outline3.webp)\n",
    "- `novelty` is an image of a house. What's more, it's a new building. But these photos have a trick: inner apartments may be under construction, but the image can't reflect it.\n",
